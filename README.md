# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

Around The US is the fourth project in the Practicum by Yandex Professional Web Developer Certificate Program.

### Description

This project makes use of the following technologies:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3 (including BEM naming conventions and file structure)
3. JavaScript

The website is fully resonsive and it's appearance corresponds (within a margin of error of 30px) with this [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1).

### Deployment & System Requirements

The project doesn't rely on any plugins or a particular build process at all. In fact, that's probably one arae where it could and should be improved - perhaps by adding in an npm scripts-based build process that concatenates and compresses the css files.

### Plans For Improvement

1. Add the ability to add/remove photos
2. Add the ability to like/heart photos
